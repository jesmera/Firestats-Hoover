Maintenance personnel requested that either the fire department or Birmingham Water Works shut off the main line at the John Hawkins Parkway vault to facilitate repairs to the suppression line.\nQuint 11 advised the maintenance crew that shutting off the main line at that location would result in a complete water outage for the entire complex, necessitating the implementation of a live fire watch. Quint 11 then informed Battalion 1 of the situation, who subsequently contacted the Fire Prevention Division to relay the incident details.\nBattalion 1 directed Quint 11 to communicate to maintenance that this matter did not fall under the fire department's jurisdiction and that the fire department would not be able to shut off the water to the complex. In response, building maintenance indicated they would request Birmingham Water Works to shut off the water supply.
